This project is a Substitution Cipher Simulator that models the encryption and decryption of text using a randomly generated keyspace. The program generates a unique mapping of each character in the alphabet to a randomly chosen substitute character, ensuring a secure and non-repetitive key. It provides functionality to encrypt plaintext messages by substituting each character with its corresponding value from the keyspace and decrypt ciphertext by reversing the substitution using the same key. The project emphasizes the principles of cryptography and includes features to display the generated key, handle invalid characters, and ensure reversible encryption. This implementation demonstrates practical use of arrays and character manipulation in Java.
